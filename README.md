# Mancala-Game
A recreation of the interactive two player board game using Java.

### Rules
- Player A always goes first.
- Each player gets 3 undos.
- The game is over when one side's pits are empty. The stones in the non-empty side are moved into that player's mancala. The player with more stones in his/her mancala at the end wins.
- When you select a pit on your side, the stones are picked up and deposited one by one into each pit that you pass, moving counterclockwise. If you pass by your own mancala, deposit a stone. Skip over your opponent's mancala.
- If the last stone you drop is in your own mancala you get a free turn.
- If the last stone you drop is in an empty pit on your side, you collect that stone and the stones in the pit on the opposite side and put them into your mancala.
